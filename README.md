# Monopoly

TODO:
 - If a player owns all the properties in a group, the base rent price is doubled. This needs to be implemented still
 
 - Add trading functionality
 
 - Add manage properties functionality
   Will include buying houses for properties.
   
 - Add in community chest and chance cards as currently landing on either of these squares will do nothing.
